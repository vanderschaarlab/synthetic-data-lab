# AAAI-23 Lab for Innovative Uses of Synthetic Data

Welcome to the AAAI-23 Lab for Innovative Uses of Synthetic Data! 
In this repository you will find materials required to complete the Lab.

The Lab will start on Wednesday, 8 February 2023, 14:00 EST.
It will be a four-hour hybrid event. Both physical and online participants need to register on the [AAAI website](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/registration/) to join the live session.

## Before the lab

We will run the hands-on session using Google Colab. As a benefit, there is no need to pre-install any library or download any dataset.

For the physical participants, please bring with you **a fully charged laptop** for the four-hour session. 
The event host has notified us that there won't be enough power sockets for everyone at the venue. 
And these sockets are allocated on a first come, first served basis. 

The Lab is based on the open-source Python library [synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity). 
To make the most out of the Lab, we recommend the participants to explore the library beforehand. Here is a list of useful materials:

- The whitepaper on synthcity and innovative uses of synthetic data (TODO)
- The GitHub repository of [synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity)
- The synthcity [documentation](https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 



## During the lab

### Schedule

| Start | End | Session Title | Description |
|-------|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 2:00pm | 2:30pm | Opening and Intro | We go through the promise of synthetic data in empowering AI development and the associated challenges.|
| 2:30pm | 3:15pm | Data Modality | We demonstrate how synthcity can generate tabular data with diverse modalities, including static data, regular and irregular time series, data with censoring, multi-source data, and composite data.|
| 3:15pm | 3:30pm | Q&A |||
| 3:30pm | 4:00pm | Break |||
| 4:00pm | 4:30pm | Fairness| We show how synthetic data can promote ML fairness by (1) augmenting minority classes with conditional generation and (2) removing bias via causal generation. |
| 4:30pm | 5:00pm | Privacy | We introduce privacy-preserving synthetic data generators that facilitates sharing of sensitive data. We will cover differential-privacy based methods as well as methods that defend against specific threat models.|
| 5:00pm | 5:30pm | Transfer | We show how to alleviate data scarcity by augmenting a small dataset using information learned from other related datasets in a transfer learning style.|
| 5:30pm | 5:45pm | Q&A	|||
| 5:45pm | 6:00pm | Further Engagement | We discuss ways of further engaging with the application and development of synthcity.|
