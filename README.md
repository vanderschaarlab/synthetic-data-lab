# AAAI-23 Lab for Innovative Uses of Synthetic Data

Welcome to the AAAI-23 Lab for Innovative Uses of Synthetic Data! 
In this repository you will find materials required to complete the Lab.

The Lab will start on Wednesday, 8 February 2023, 14:00 EST.
It will be a four-hour hybrid event. Both physical and online participants need to register on the [AAAI website](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/registration/) to join the live session.

## Before the lab

We will run the hands-on session using Google Colab. As a benefit, there is no need to pre-install any library or download any dataset.

For the physical participants, please bring with you **a fully charged laptop** for the four-hour session. 
The event host has notified us that there won't be enough power sockets for everyone at the venue. 
And these sockets are allocated on a first come, first served basis. 

The Lab is based on the open-source Python library [synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity). 
To make the most out of the Lab, we recommend the participants to explore the library beforehand. Here is a list of useful materials:

- The whitepaper on synthcity and innovative uses of synthetic data (TODO)
- The GitHub repository of [synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity)
- The synthcity [documentation](https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
